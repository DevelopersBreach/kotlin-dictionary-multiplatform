## About This Project

This project is part of a collaborative learning effort by students passionate about Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and cross-platform development. It is being built as we explore and experiment with Kotlin Multiplatform capabilities.

We're exploring core Kotlin concepts and building this app as a way to document our journey, reinforce what we learn, and share it with others along the way.

The Kotlin Dictionary project is being guided by [@RajashekarRaju](https://github.com/RajashekarRaju), who mentors contributors throughout the process. This includes:

- Providing architectural guidance
- Reviewing contributions
- Suggesting improvements
- Promoting best practices in Kotlin development

We're all learning together, and the code evolves as we grow!

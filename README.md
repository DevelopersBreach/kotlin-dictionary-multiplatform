Kotlin Dictionary is a student-led, cross-platform app designed to help learners dive deep into the Kotlin programming language. It serves as an interactive reference where you can explore topics with clear explanations and reinforce your learning through quizzes.   
‚ú® _The data is powered by AI tools which help automate content generation, ensure consistency, and speed up the documentation._

## About This Project

This project is part of a collaborative learning effort by students passionate about Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and cross-platform development. It is being built as we explore and experiment with Kotlin Multiplatform capabilities.

We're exploring core Kotlin concepts and building this app as a way to document our journey, reinforce what we learn, and share it with others along the way.

The Kotlin Dictionary project is being guided by [@RajashekarRaju](https://github.com/RajashekarRaju), who mentors contributors throughout the process. This includes:

- Providing architectural guidance
- Reviewing contributions
- Suggesting improvements
- Promoting best practices in Kotlin development

We're all learning together, and the code evolves as we grow!
